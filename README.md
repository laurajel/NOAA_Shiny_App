# NOAA_Shiny_App
Shiny App for Algae Blooms in the Gulf of Mexico


### Purpose:
#### To identify trends in harmful algae grouth over the years from 01/2000 to 12/2018


### Importance:
#### Harmful algae blooms or "Red Tide" can kill ocean wild life and be a threat to humans. It is crucial for us to
#### find trends so we can decrease the incidence of algae blooms in the Golf of Mexico.


### Dataset:
#### The NOAAs Harmful Algae Survaillence Data, N = > 150,000 observations

### Factors of Interest:
#### Cell count(cells/L)
#### Water Temperature (F)
#### Location of measurement 
#### Year
#### Month


### Trends observed:
#### The data were missing quite a few values, out of a Population of over 150,000, only 6,000 algae measurements were 
#### included. This was due to a large number of outliers which were eliminated, a large number of NA values, and the lack of 
#### observations in certain years. In some years, it is quite obvious that large measurements were taken in the warmer months.
